Daily Coding Problem is an open source. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

## Branching strategy

-   **Always** base your changes on the `master` branch (all new development happens here),
-   When you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as target, otherwise it
    will be closed (this is selected by default).

## Tests

-   Write a test for each use case.
-   Try to stick to one assertion per use case.
-   Too thorough is better than not thorough enough

## Programming Language
-   Try writing in other Languages than Python.
